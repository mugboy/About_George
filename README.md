# About_George
Once upon a time, there
was a little boy named George.

He liked math and science and he was a **huge** fan of Apple.

When he was a little kid, his teachers thought he would never get a career
and he was below average just by thinking long.

So he learned at home until he was a teenager.

He went to a better school than last time and when he was
18, he went to university.

He learned math and programming and his career was a mathmetician
and his hobby was programming Markdown and other mark-up languages.

He liked mark-up languages more than programming languages.
